Freelancer Portfolio — WordPress theme (generated)
================================================

Installation:
1. Upload the 'freelancer-portfolio' folder to wp-content/themes/ or install the ZIP via Appearance -> Themes -> Add New -> Upload Theme.
2. Activate the theme.
3. Go to Projects -> Add New to create project posts (set featured images).
4. Go to Testimonials -> Add New for testimonials.
5. Set a menu in Appearance -> Menus and assign it to 'Primary Menu'.
6. Test the contact form — it submits via AJAX and sends mail to the site's admin email (set in Settings -> General).

Notes:
- Replace the hero image at assets/img/hero-placeholder.png.
- The theme is intentionally minimal and easy to extend: child templates and styles can be added in assets/.
- Security: the contact form uses WP nonces and server-side sanitization. Make sure your host allows wp_mail or configure SMTP plugin.

Enjoy — replace content and styles to match your personal brand.
